MVP Game Design: 'Immortal Front: Age of Heroes'
Here's a streamlined MVP (Minimum Viable Product) plan for 'Immortal Front: Age of Heroes', focusing on core gameplay elements to ensure a quick launch and iterative development.

1. MVP Game Overview
Game Title: Immortal Front: Age of Heroes

Genre: Hero Progression RPG (Idle, PvP)

Platform: Mobile Web (Play instantly in browser, no installation required)

Core Objectives:

Simple Hero Progression: Focus on hero growth without complex base management.

Immediate PvP Experience: Prioritize providing core 1v1 PvP combat.

Web Game Accessibility: Ensure fast loading and seamless gameplay.

2. MVP Core Gameplay: Hero Progression & 1v1 PvP
The MVP version centers entirely on main hero progression and 1v1 PvP combat using that hero.

2.1. Hero Progression (Idle-Centric)
Main Hero: Players choose and focus on a single main hero who serves as the core of all content.

Idle Combat: Heroes automatically battle monsters and acquire experience points and basic resources (gold, materials) even when the player is offline.

Implement an offline reward system to claim accumulated loot upon login.

Equipment: Equip the hero with weapons and armor obtained through idle hunting or quests to boost combat power.

Equipment is categorized simply by Rarity (Common, Rare, Epic, etc.) and Enhancement Level (+1, +2, etc.) to minimize system complexity.

Skill Acquisition/Enhancement: As the hero levels up, they'll learn new skills or enhance existing ones. (This can be a simple skill tree or fixed skill progression.)

Hero Level Cap: The initial hero level cap for the MVP will be set low to allow players to experience quick progression.

2.2. Streamlined Production System: 'The Workshop'
There's no base building. Instead, a single 'Workshop' exists to support hero progression.

Workshop Functions: Craft equipment, potions, and enhancement materials needed by the hero.

Materials are primarily obtained through idle hunting, or the Workshop itself can produce small amounts.

Simple UI: Avoid complex production lines. A straightforward UI will display craftable items, required materials, and allow crafting to start with a single click.

Time Consumption: Crafting takes time, which can be instantly completed using premium currency.

3. MVP Core PvP Content: The Arena
The MVP version focuses on the most direct and central PvP experience: 'The Arena'.

Ranked Duels (Asynchronous PvP):

Players battle an AI-controlled opposing hero based on another player's current hero combat power.

Winning increases ranking points and grants honor points. Losing results in a point decrease.

Auto-Combat: Arena battles are fully automatic, emphasizing the importance of hero stats, equipment, and skill combinations rather than player control. (Minimal player intervention.)

Honor Shop: A dedicated shop where players can purchase special equipment or enhancement materials exclusively with honor points earned from the Arena, incentivizing PvP participation.

Seasonal Operation: Ranking seasons will run on a weekly/monthly basis, with rewards distributed based on rank at the end of each season.

4. MVP Monetization Model (Minimalist)
At the MVP stage, the game will introduce only essential monetization features to ensure players can enjoy the game without feeling pressured to spend.

Time Skip Items: Items that instantly complete crafting, enhancement, or other time-gated activities.

Resource Packs: Bundles of basic resources like gold and enhancement materials needed for progression.

Cosmetic Items: Simple skins to change the hero's appearance.

Ad Viewing: Players can watch optional ads to gain extra offline rewards, reduce crafting times, and more.
